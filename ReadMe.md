# My Name is Surendar Mani
## This is my ReadMe file for GIT practical Hands-on
### For understanding Short status better git status --short or git status -s
#### gitignore dap files 
##### git diff validation - with git diff / git diff --cached / git diff --staged
##### Understanding git commit with inclusion of -a ---> git commit -a -m "Commit without git add"
##### Removing the file from stage alone after doing git add and leaving it in local, similar case as gitignore but staged the file by mistake ---> git rm --cached sample.html
##### Renaming the filename with move command ---> mv Sample.txt NewSample.txt (It performs the operation of git rm Sample.txt & git add NewSample.txt)
##### Undo the early commit or after messing up with the commit ---> git commit --amend
##### Unstaging a Staged File - 1
##### Adding remote repositories using git remote add / git fetch
